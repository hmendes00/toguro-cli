# Toguro CLI

This is the CLI to create Toguro Apps.

## Instalation

```
npm install -g @toguro/cli
```


## Basic commands

```
toguro --create-app name-of-app // this will add the toguro-app template to your current directory

toguro --generate-app-id // this will print a new app-id that can be used in your new app
```

## ROADMAP

We are working on adding the following commands soon:

```
toguro --login // login to your dev account

toguro --publish // publish app to Toguro App Marketplace

toguro --create-client-app // create a client where you can test your app
```

## How to can I test and publish Apps in the meantime?
